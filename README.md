# Protein Structure Comparison 🧬

## Description 📝
This repository is dedicated to scripts and methodologies for comparing the structures of proteins 🔄. It includes tools for performing pairwise alignments, multiple sequence alignments, and calculating key metrics like TM-scores and RMSDs to assess structural similarity.

## Project Goals 🎯
- To provide a set of tools for bioinformatics analysis focusing on protein structure comparison.
- To facilitate the understanding of structural similarities and differences between proteins, potentially revealing functional insights 🤔.

## Contents 📦
- Scripts for pairwise and multiple sequence alignment 🔀.
- Code for calculating TM-scores and RMSD, important metrics for structural comparison 🔍.
- Visualization tools for comparing protein structures 📊.

## Installation and Usage ⚙️
Instructions on setting up the environment, installing necessary dependencies, and a step-by-step guide on how to use the scripts for protein structure comparison.
